Simple boids simulation written in rust, core of it written over the course of a weekend or two :)

# Functionality that would be cool/ fun to add

- [ ] predator mode with the mouse
- [ ] perching behavior 
- [ ] color mode
      The boids will try to flock with other boids that have similar colors as them
- [ ] matching mode
      the longer boids flock together as a group, their color begins to shift to match the average color of their neighborhood
      could also play fun with color mode, it would create almost like a battle to see which color is more dominant
- [ ] boids that have been straggling/alone for a while will start to change color to a new random color, to avoid homogenity in the simulation

- [ ] evil mode, if a boid is neglected or alone for too long, it tries to kill other boids
